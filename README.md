This a repository that allow you to efficiently train your network on multi-source image fusion task, including 

- *Pansharpening*,
- *hyperspectral and multispectral image fusion (HMIF)*,
- *visual and infared image fusion*,
- *medical image fusion*.

> We call the first two as sharpening tasks and the latter two as fusion tasks.

This framework is tested on Python 3.9.x / 3.11 and Pytorch 2.3.0 with CUDA 11.8.


# NEWSâœ¨
2024.07.24: Some downstream tasks: a) detection task; b) segmentation task, c) depth estimation are ready to release.

2024.06.27: We release VIS-IR and medical image fusion training scripts. 

2024.04.06: Release the some pansharpening and hyperspectral and multispectral image fusion methods. You can found in `model/`.


# Quick StartðŸŽˆ

## Installation Requirements

You can simply install all needed Python packages by running `pip install -r requirement.txt`.

## Prepare Your Model

You can put in your model and register with the model name that you prefer using `register_model`, then import your model in `model/__init__.py`. 

> We are trying using `hydra` dynamic importing. So, this api may be changed.

Specify your model's `train_step`, `val_step` and `patch_merge_step` (optional) if you are working on *Pansharpening* and *HMIF* tasks, or, if you are working *VIS-IR* and *medical image fusion* tasks, you should specify the `train_fusion_step` and `val_fusion_step` functions.

 You can find detailed example usage in the `model/`.


## Starting Training

Here are two scripts for training your model. 

1. scripts implemented by torch-run.
2. scripts implemented by Huggingface Accelerate. 

> We recommand the latter one.

We take the second choice as the example:

### Sharpening Tasks

For sharpening tasks, you should modify the `scripts/torch_sharpening_run.sh` to feed your model name (after you register it), dataset name, and more options.

Then run it by

```shell
sh scripts/torch_sharpening_run.sh
```

- Train logs will be saved in `log_file/`.
- Tensorboard logs will be saved in `runs/`.
- Trained weights will be saved in `weights/`.

### Fusion Tasks

For fusion tasks, you should switch to `scripts/accelerate_run.sh` and modify it to suit your way.


### Inference

After you trained your model, you need to infer model on test set.

- For sharpening tasks, you need to put the path of the weight in `inference.py` and run it.

- For fusion tasks, you need to run `scripts/torch_sharpening_run.sh` (after you modify it to suit your model).


## Test Metrics

We provide the Matlab package to test the metrics on those four tasks. Please check them in `Pansharpening_Hyper_SR_Matlab_Test_Package` and `VIS_IR_Matlab_Test_Package`.

### Basic Usage

- For sharpening tasks, you simply test the metrics in Matlab

``` matlab
cd Pansharpening_Hyper_SR_Matlab_Test_Package

%% when testing the reduced-resolution metrics on pansharpening or HMIF tasks
% Args:
% path: the saved fused image `.mat` file, find it in `visualized_img/`
% ratio: upscale ratio, e.g., 4
% full_res: we keep it to 1, not changed
% const: max value of the dataset
analysis_ref_batched_images(path, ratio, full_res, const)

%% when testing full-resolution metrics on pansharpening datasets
% Args:
% path: the saved fused image `.mat` file, find it in `visualized_img/`
% ratio: upscale ratio, e.g., 4
% sensor: the sensor name
analysis_unref_batched_images(path, ratio, sensor)
```
> You need to define the data paths (h5 file paths). Find them in the matlab test scripts mentioned above.

<!-- 
- For fusion tasks, you can run `runDir` in `VIS_IR_Matlab_Test_Package/` in Matlab.

``` matlab
cd VIS_IR_Matlab_Test_Package;

% Args:
% vi_dir: visible images dir
% ir_dir: infrared images dir
% fusion_dir: fused images from your model
% method_name: the name of the method
% test_mode_easy (0 or 1): some metrics may use much time to test;
%                          1 for east, 0 for overall metrics to test.
% test_ext: vi and ir image extension, default to be png.
% fused_ext: fused image extension, default to be png.
runDir(vi_dir, ir_dir, fusion_dir, method_name, test_mode_easy, varargin)

% and also a multiprocessing test matlab script is involved.
mp_run(fusion_dir, dataset_name, method_name, rgb_test, test_mode_easy, varargin)
```
If you find it is troublesome to open an matlab to test, we prepare a python script to help you test with matlab process in background.

```python
python py_run_matlab_VIS_IR_test.py -f <your/fused/path> -m <your_method_name> -d <dataset_name>
```

# Downstream tasksðŸ§¨
In VIS-IR fusion task, it's often two choices to test an fusion model with some downstreams tasks, for example: a. *detection*, *segmentation* and *depth estimation*.

In this repo, we introduce two SOTA downstream models to test the fusion models: for detection, we choose YOLOv5 and YOLOv10; for segmentation, we choose MaskFormer and Mask2Former. -->

# About Dataset

We colloct panshapening, HMIF, VIS-IR image fusion, and medical image fusion datasets from previous works. Really appreciate their great works!

The used datasets includes:
- Pansharpenging: [WorldView-3, GaoFen-2, QuickBird datasets](https://liangjiandeng.github.io/PanCollection.html);
- HMIF: indoor [CAVE and Harvard datasets](https://github.com/shangqideng/PSRT?tab=readme-ov-file#data), remote sensing [Paiva, Houston, Washington datasets](https://github.com/liangjiandeng/HyperPanCollection);
- VIS-IR fusion: MSRS, LLVIP, M3FD, TNO and Roadscene datasets;
- Medical image fusion: MedHavrad SPECT-MRI, PET-MRI, and CT-MRI datasets.

We are planning to release some of them.
